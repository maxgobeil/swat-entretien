## Development

This website was developed with a focus on:

- Clean, maintainable code
- Simplicity
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-first approach

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages. The setup ensures that any changes pushed to the main branch are immediately reflected on the live site, making it efficient to maintain and update the website.

### How it works:

- Every push to the main branch triggers an automatic deployment
- GitHub Pages serves the site from the repository directly
- Changes are typically live within a few minutes of pushing
- The CNAME file ensures the custom domain configuration persists

### Making Updates:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make necessary changes (e.g., updating form, content, or styling)
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. Changes will automatically deploy to the live site

### Monitoring:

- Deployment status can be checked in the repository's "Actions" tab
- The "Environments" section shows the current deployment status
- GitHub provides deployment logs if needed
